        id="HardcodedDebugMode"
        message="Hardcoded value of `android:debuggable` can interfere with debug/release builds"
        category="Security"
        priority="5"
        summary="Hardcoded value of `android:debuggable` in the manifest"
        explanation="It's best to leave out the `android:debuggable` attribute from the manifest. If you do, then the tools will automatically insert `android:debuggable=true` when building an APK to debug on an emulator or device. And when you perform a release build, such as Exporting APK, it will automatically set it to `false`.&#xA;&#xA;If on the other hand you specify a specific value in the manifest file, then the tools will always use it. This can lead to accidentally publishing your app with debug information.">
